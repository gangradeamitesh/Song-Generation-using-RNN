# Song-Generation-using-RNN
Generation songs using word embedding and LSTM.
This is kind of Fun project using RNN to generate the songs/Rap.
What i did is i have collected some of the lyrics of Divine(Rapper) and wrote the RNN alogrithm using word embedding and LSTM.
It works quite good better then expected but it gets collapse after 20 words ut starts repeating the words.
The model need more data to be feeded to work better.
You can train the model in Google Collab it take around 12-15 min to get trained in Google colab using GPU.
You can feed more data and play with algorithm by Using GRU at the place of LSTM(I personally like LSTM it works better).
